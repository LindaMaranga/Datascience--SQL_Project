To aid a US presidential candidate, we would like to understand the states where he/she should focus campaign efforts in order to secure a win the upcoming presidential elections.

In each of the 51 states, there is a given number of grand electors to win and the presidential candidate receiving the most local votes wins ALL the Grand Electors in that state.

However,it is impotant to note that the number of grand electors is not exactly proportional to the population.

Therefore, the objective of this study is identify which states we need to prioritize in our campaigns to ensure the we win the most votes and/or which states have the highest grand electors per capita.
